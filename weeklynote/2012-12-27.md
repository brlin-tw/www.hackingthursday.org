[[file mysql_wp_benchmarks_innodb.pdf | MySQL 5.5: Storage Engine Performance Benchmark for MyISAM and InnoDB]]

Full-text search indexes in MyISAM are
useful for many simple read-only web applications, though often users deploy MySQL and InnoDB
with Sphinx or Lucene for fast text searches as an alternative to MyISAM.

Other use cases that are potentially suitable for MyISAM include:
• Applications demanding very high raw INSERT speeds where concurrency is not a
consideration. Performance will always be application dependent, so benchmarking is
necessary to determine the best solution for your own environment.
• Caches or temporary tables.
• Blogs / Wikis / RSS feeds.
• Read-only tables.
