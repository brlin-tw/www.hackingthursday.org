Puppet, Chef
Ansible, SaltStack

Which should I choose: Chef, Puppet, Ansible, SaltStack, Docker, or something else? - Quora

* Chef and Puppet, primarily have the pull based approach i.e. clients continuously poll the master node. SaltStack uses push based approach i.e. to push the config to clients. Ansible, whereas, supports both push and pull.
* Scripting for Chef and Puppet not an easy task; considered a programmer's job in many opinions. Whereas, Ansible and SaltStack use yaml configurations.
